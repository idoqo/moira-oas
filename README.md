## Contributing
The OpenAPI configuration files are kept in the `api/` folder. To bundle them into a single `yaml` file,
Install [APIDevTools/swagger-cli](https://github.com/APIDevTools/swagger-cli) globally with:
```bash
$ npm -i g swagger-cli
```
Next, change into the `api` folder with `cd api` and bundle all of the OpenAPI files into a single `swagger.yml` file.
```bash
$ swagger-cli bundle main.yml -o swagger.yml
```

Additionally, you can view the documentation locally using Docker by running docker-compose in the project root directory.
```bash
$ docker-compose up
```
Once the containers are up, visit the URL at http://localhost:9900 to view the Redoc-rendered documentation or 
http://localhost:9901 to view the SwaggerUI version.

_**NOTE:** To use the "Try it out" feature on SwaggerUI, ensure that `enable_cors` is set o true in your
API config at `/etc/moira/api.yml`._
