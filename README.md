# Moira OpenAPI Specification
[GSoC 2020 Project](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5733016854331392)

If you are new to Moira, check out the main [Moira repository](https://github.com/moira-alert/moira/).

The pre-built docker image is available on docker hub at [idoko/moira-oas](https://hub.docker.com/r/idoko/moira-oas).
## Usage
The OpenAPI description files are kept in a folder that corresponds to the path name. Components that are shared across
 OpenAPI operations live in the `shared` folder i.e:
- `shared/parameters`: Contains the different parameters (they are all kept in a single
`_index.yml`) file as they are not many enough to warrant individual files.
- `shared/responses`: Responses that can be shared by different operations (such as errors)
- `shared/schemas`: Schemas correspond to `dto` files in the main Moira repository. They usually 
live in their own files due to their size. See [Issue #44](https://github.com/moira-alert/doc/issues/44) for details. 
To bundle them into a single `yaml` file,
Install [APIDevTools/swagger-cli](https://github.com/APIDevTools/swagger-cli) globally with:
```bash
$ npm -i g swagger-cli
```
The command to merge them is already defined in the `Makefile`. To use it, run
```bash
$ make spec
```
And it will generate the final documentation file in `build/openapi.yml`

Additionally, you can view the documentation locally using Docker by running docker-compose in the project root directory.
```bash
$ docker-compose up
```
Once the containers are up, visit the URL at http://localhost:9900 to view the SwaggerUI documentation or 
http://localhost:9901 to view the Redoc version.

_**NOTE:** To use the "Try it out" feature on SwaggerUI, ensure that `enable_cors` is set to true in your
API config at `/etc/moira/api.yml`._
